  Carcassone is an interesting board game that supports
  up to five players. The players take turn to draw and place
  a `tile' on board and decides to place a `follower' to some
  regions on that tile or not so as to occupy that region.
  The scores will be awarded according to the regions occupied
  and the game rules. The score will be awarded as the game develops.
  After placing all the tiles, final scores will be calculated
  according to the current setting.
  However, it is often not easy for a human player
  to compute the scores correctly, especially for complicated rules
  such as `field'. 
  This report introduces 
  a computer progam that can automatically compute the score
  of the final game setting from a given image.
  The experimental result shows that our implementation can 
  calculate the score efficiently and correctly.
