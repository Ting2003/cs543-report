\section{Tile Extraction}
After taking the pictures, we have to extract tiles from the pictures.
In this section, we are going to discuss details about the tile 
extraction process.

Figure~\ref{Original_im} shows the whole picture without follower. 
In the extraction process, the aim is to extract the boundary lines of 
tiles. Since hough transformation method is good for detecting lines, we
first extracted edge pixels with canny edge detector and tried hough 
transform to detect boundary lines of tiles. However, the result is not 
good. A lot of boundary lines of tiles are missing, and we can not recover 
the boundary lines for each tile.

We propose another method which can effectively extract the boundary lines of
 tiles. The main process is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Extract edge map with oriented filters.
	
			Use oriented filters, we first extract and edge information of the 
			pictures. We assume all the boundary lines of tiles are along horizontal 
			and vertical direction. As a result, we only keep edge pixel whose 
			magnitude is within $5\,^{\circ}$ of horizontal and vertical direction. 
			The extracted edge map is shown in Figure~\ref{Edge_map}.

				  \label{Edge_map}
			\end{figure}
			
	\item Extract boundary lines with connected component method.
	
			After extracting edge map with oriented filters, there are still a lot of 
			discontinuous edge pixels in edge map. Most of these edge pixels are within 
			the tile boundaries and is not of our interest. As a result, we filter these 
			discontinuous edge pixels with some threshold. Then, we treat the continuous 
			pixels in edge map as a component, and extract boundary line of these components.
			Again, we keep those lines which are very close to horizontal and vertical ones.
			The resulting distribution of extracted lines are shown in Figure~\ref{Connect}.
			In Figure~\ref{Connect}, the white lines are those edges after filtering step but 
			are beyond the thresholding range of horizontal and vertical lines.

			\end{figure}
			
	\item  Merge lines to fit for boundaries of tiles.
			
			In Figure~\ref{Connect}, we can see that the extracted lines covers most of the tile 
			boundaries. Although a few boundary lines are missing, it can be recovered by boundary 
			lines along the same row or column. We can see that some in some region, there are several 
			boundary lines making a thick line region. On the other hand, there are also some other false 
			short lines in Figure~\ref{Connect}. Both of these two case need to be take care of. 
			
			First we extend all the lines and intersect the lines with the boundary of image. Then, for 
			the thick line region, we utilized non-maximum like technique to produce a thin line. Specifically, 
			we search the neighborhood of each line, and if there exist some other lines nearby, we merge the 
			neighboring lines. We accumulate all the number of pixels the merged lines covered in edge map. 
			Observing the true boundary lines and false boundary lines, we can see that the false lines covers 
			only a very small part of pixels in edge map, while the true lines covers much larger number of pixels 
			in edge map. With this feature, we set a threshold for the number of pixels each line covered in edge 
			map, and those false lines are filtered out. 
			
			Until this point, most of the boundary lines are true ones, while there might still be several false 
			edges. In order to effectively eliminate these lines, we perform histogram of distance along every two 
			neighboring lines along horizontal and vertical directions. The higher the distance, the higher weight 
			for the distance will be. The peak of the histogram represents the horizontal and vertical side length 
			of each tile. We then start from the first line from horizontal and vertical direction, and 
			incrementally add the voted side length. In order to avoid the accumulate error, we round the added 
			results to the true line position. The results of merging lines is shown in Figure~\ref{Merge_line}.
